        <p class="mb-4">
          To support on-campus testing of AUVs and associated autonomy, estimation, and 
          perception algorithms the FRoSt lab maintains a test tank facility consisting of 
          a 20ft x 30ft x 6ft indoor test tank.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-4">
          To support the operation of the tank, the AUV testing facility includes an operations 
          platform, overhead hoist, water filtration, and necessary computing systems to perform 
          on-campus testing of AUV systems.
        </p>
        <p>
          This on-campus facility enables initial and frequent testing of developed systems and 
          methods in preparation for in-situ testing in lakes, reservoirs, and ocean field trials.

        <p class="mb-4">
          In addition to the on-campus test tank facility, the FRoSt lab has access to 
          multiple university-owned boats that can be used for frequent in-situ testing 
          in nearby reservoirs and lakes. The boundaries of the state of Utah in particular 
          include over 600 lakes and reservoirs that can be used for testing.
        </p>
        <p>
          The FRoSt lab additionally plans regular field trials on both the east and 
          west coasts to support in-ocean testing.
