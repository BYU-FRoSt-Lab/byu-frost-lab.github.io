### What is High-Level Synthesis?
High-Level Synthesis (HLS) is a hardware design method that uses high-level abstraction to optimize and implement RTL on an FPGA. It allows designers to create custom digital circuits by using languages such as C, C++ or OpenCL.


### Why High-Level Synthesis?
Using hardware description languages like Verilog or VHDL to design the hardware is usually complicated and time-consuming. HLS provides an easier way to implement the same algorithm by merely using a high-level language. It simplifies and speeds up the design process.


### Our Goal
While HLS is a very useful tool, optimizing its results still requires expert knowledge of the FPGA and hardware design. Our goal is to create an open-source tool that enables hardware acceleration of robotic algorithms with minimal required user hardware knowledge.
