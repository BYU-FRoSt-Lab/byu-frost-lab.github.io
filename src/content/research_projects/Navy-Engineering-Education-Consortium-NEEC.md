Our lab is currently receiving funding from the Naval Engineering Education Consortium (NEEC) project. Several undergraduate students are working to iterate and build upon previous open source designs for a low cost unmanned underwater vehicle (UUV). The goal of this project is to build simple and cheap UUV vehicles that we can use for cooperative robotic applications. Potential sensor payload packages include acoustic modems, a ping echo sounder or DVL, and an inertial measurement unit. In addition to adding a few more robots around the lab, students are getting first hand experience of system development and how to design and build for robustness.
