The Autonomous Wheelchair project is working to develop an all-terrain, stairclimbing wheelchair to help those with limited control to access the outdoors and enjoy travel that may have not been previously available to them more readily. Through the use of Lidar sensors, cameras, encoders, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU) we can create a 3D map and know the exact location of the wheelchair relative to its surroundings. This map can then be used to plan trajectories and ensure safety when navigating.

## Our Autonomous Wheelchair Platform
The autonomous wheelchair will be equipped with Lidar sensors, cameras, encoders, and an inertial measurement unit (IMU). With the Lidar sensors the wheelchair will be able to map its surroundings and detect potential obstacles in its path. The cameras will help to fill in the gaps the lidar sensors cannot see, as well as help identify different objects. The encoders and IMU will be used to keep track of the wheelchair’s exact location. The wheelchair also has a large set of wheels so that it can navigate through different terrains such as up a set of stairs or the side of a mountain.
