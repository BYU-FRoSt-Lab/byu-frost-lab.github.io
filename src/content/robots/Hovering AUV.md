## Our AUV Design

This AUV serves as our main underwater testing vehicle. Its modular 80/20-based design, 3D-printed parts, and easily accessible enclosures allows for flexibility in testing both new hardware and software configurations. It is also easy to transport and operate at a size of approximately 31" x 24" x 18".

Our vehicle is equipped with a wide variety of sensors for collecting environmental data, including sonar, stereo cameras, a doppler velocity log (DVL), an inertial measurement unit (IMU), and a GPS antenna. It also hosts significant on-board processing, containing an NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier, a PYNQ board, and two Raspberry Pi units. Power is distributed throughout the vehicle from its four 266 Wh batteries using custom-printed circuit boards. Its eight 11 lbf thrusters allow it to both travel quickly and hover steadily in most underwater environments.
