#  About

Alejandro Pelaez is an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering from Bogota, Colombia. He joined the FROST Lab in August of 2025 under Dr. Brady Moon. His research interests span the areas of controls, autonomy, and aerial robotics with an interest to pursue a PhD in Aerospace Engineering or Robotics with a focus on developing intelligent multi-agent aerial systems.

In his personal time he enjoys watching movies with his wife, particularly dramas, comedies, or musicals. He also enjoys narrative driven videogames and soulsbornes. He's also a music enjoyer, attending different music festivals and concerts around Utah and being part of BYU Men's Chorus, being an avid singer. 


# Research

Alejandro’s current research focuses on developing weighted node graphs for robotic traversal. His work involves utilizing computer vision and deep learning methods to segment paths starting from satellite images.

The ultimate goal of his research is to help develop a robust path planner which would then be tested in simulation and then deployed on ground robots.
