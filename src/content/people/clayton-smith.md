# About

Clayton Smith is an undergraduate in Computer Engineering. He joined the FROST Lab in September 2023. Clayton is interested in studying Machine Learning algorithms for robotics.


# Research

Clayton has designed an upgraded C++ driver for the Seatrac x150 Acoustic Modems. These will be used to send signals between different CougUVs. They are capable of determining distance and direction for each message sent between the CougUVs – an important feature for the algorithms we will be testing.
