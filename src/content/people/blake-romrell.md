# About
Blake Paul Romrell is a Graduate Student majoring in Computer Engineering, in the Electrical and computer Engineering department with an undergraduate degree in Applied Physics, with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics from BYU (graduated April 2023). He joined the FROST Lab in May 2023.

From Centerville, Utah, Blake enjoys video games and books, board games and scifi-shows with his wife, D&D with his friends, and competitive recurve archery

# Research
As of Summer of 2023, Blake is working on the HoloOcean simulator project, and the Natural Language Processing (NLP) project. The HoloOcean simulator is an ongoing project in the FROST Lab, that is an open source simulator for underwater robotics and sonar, and he is helping to maintain and investigating methods for improving the sonar simulation's fidelity to real world behavior. The NLP project has a long term goal of creating a system such that from natural language textbooks on coral reefs, robots can use the information from those sources to make intelligent mission decisions for scientific missions. Currently we are working on the extracting information portion of this project.
