# About

Bridget Beatson is an undergraduate student in BYU’s Department of Mechanical Engineering, with a secondary major in Linguistics (expected graduation April 2022). She joined the FROST Lab in August 2020 after working for several years with Dr. Howell and Dr. Magleby in the Compliant Mechanisms Research Group. She was also involved this past year in developing autonomous rover functionality as part of the 2021 BYU Mars Rover competition team.

Bridget’s research interests include autonomy, machine learning, and robotic exploration. Outside of her immersion in academics, she enjoys skiing, visiting new places, playing musical instruments, and tinkering with random engineering ideas. However, she admits to spending most of her free time learning new languages, or at least practicing the ones she already knows.

# Research

Bridget's research aims to increase the efficiency of path planning and data collection by AUVs, through algorithms that utilize both pre-embedded scientific knowledge and inferred environmental patterns.
