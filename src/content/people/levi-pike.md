Levi is working on finishing up his undergraduate studies in Computer Engineering at BYU, with minors in Computer Science and Mathematics. He joined the FROST Lab in Fall 2020, after working in Dr. Goodrich's HCMI lab. His research interests vary widely, but are focused on the intersecting spaces between Embedded Systems and Deep Learning, Edge compute, Swarm Robotics, Network Theory, and IoT. In other words, he loves to research the improvements associated with decentralized systems of all types!

When not knee deep in research papers or swing dancing, he enjoys a good game of racquetball, pickleball, or Ultimate, and likes leveraging his technical experiences to teach kids to code! He is also an advocate of financial literacy, spaced-repetition based education, data privacy, and Costco muffins as an acceptable form of birthday cake.
