#  About

Seth Knoop is an undergraduate student in the Electrical and Computer Engineering department, on track to earn his bachelor's degree in April 2026. He joined the FROST Lab as a third-year student in May 2025.

His academic interests span circuitry, coding, and controls, with plans to pursue a Master’s degree and eventually a PhD.

Outside of academics, Seth enjoys illustration, music, and writing. He has completed several long-term passion projects, including a graphic novel and a short film. He also spends time hiking and camping, where he finds much of his creative inspiration.

# Research

Seth’s research focuses on semantic mapping for coastal environments. He is developing a pipeline that combines LiDAR-generated 3D point clouds with object labels identified from photographs using vision models (including SAM, CLIP, and DINO). He primarily focuses on the object identification processes. The ultimate goal is to create a text-driven system that allows users to query the environment.
