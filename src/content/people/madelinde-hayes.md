#  About

Maddie is an undergraduate student in Computer Engineering, with plans to pursue a Master’s degree. She joined the FROST Lab in September 2024 as a Sophomore. In addition to the FROST Lab, she works for Utah Underwater Robotics (UUR).

While originally drawn to photography and other arts, she has become increasingly interested in the programming side of image processing and scientific visualization. Beyond her academics, Maddie enjoys baking, video games, music, and napping with her cat.


# Research

Maddie's research focuses on underwater photogrammetry of Hawaii’s coral reef ecosystems, with the goal of supporting reef monitoring.

Her research aims to improve the quality of underwater images and videos through refined post-processing techniques. The enhanced images are then used to construct 3D maps using photogrammetry software.
