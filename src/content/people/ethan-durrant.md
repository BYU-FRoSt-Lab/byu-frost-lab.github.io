Ethan hails from San Francisco, and is currently an undergraduate student studying Computer Engineering, with minors in Computer Science and Japanese. He joined the FROST lab in February 2021 after working briefly as a TA in the department, and spending 2 years as an Assistant Linux SysAdmin for the CAEDM labs. Being a perpetual tinkerer, Ethan has enjoyed working with electronics, robots, and computing for as long as he can remember. In High School he helped build robots as a member of Team 4159 in the FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC). Within the FROST lab he is currently incorporating precision timing synchronization and sensor control on the lab's AUVs.

Ethan has a passion for working with Embedded Systems and loves treading the murky line between Hardware and Software. Recently he has been delving deeper into the realm of FPGA's and their use alongside embedded processors. Outside of his schooling he enjoys many hobbies, most recently designing custom mechanical keyboard kits , modding watches, studying Japanese, and working on personal side projects.
