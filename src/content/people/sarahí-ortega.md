# About
Sarahi Ortega is a master’s student in Computer Engineering at Brigham Young University. She completed her undergraduate degree in Computer Engineering with a minor in Mathematics in April 2025 and joined the FROST Lab in May 2025.

Originally from Guayaquil, Ecuador, Sarahi moved to the U.S. in 2022 for college. She enjoys working in areas related to signal processing, computer vision, and robotics. Outside of academics, she loves baking, hiking, and doing nails.

# Research
Sarahi is working on the HoloOcean simulator project, an open-source underwater robotics and sonar simulation platform. Her current work focuses on maintaining and expanding the simulator’s capabilities, particularly in generating realistic underwater environments. She is exploring the use of techniques such as 3D Gaussian splatting to support dynamic and user-driven scene creation for more effective training and testing of robotic algorithms.
