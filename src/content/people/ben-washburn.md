#  About

Ben Washburn is an undergraduate student studying Electrical Engineering at Brigham Young University. He joined the Field Robotics Systems and Technology Laboratory (FRoSt Lab) in 2025.

Originally from Ridgecrest, California, Ben is passionate about developing autonomous systems that can operate effectively in complex, real-world environments. Outside the lab, he enjoys running, hiking, and playing frisbee.


# Research

Ben’s current research focuses on Active Cooperation Terrain-Aided Navigation using Inverted USBL. His work involves developing strategies that allow autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) to intelligently coordinate with each other for better localization.

The ultimate goal of his research is to improve the robustness and precision of terrain-aided navigation through cooperative strategies, making underwater robotic systems more reliable for tasks such as exploration, mapping, and environmental monitoring.
