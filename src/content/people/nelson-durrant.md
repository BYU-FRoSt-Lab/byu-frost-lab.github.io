# About
Nelson is currently an undergraduate at Brigham Young University studying Computer Engineering with a minor in Computer Science. He's especially interested in machine learning and autonomy, and is planning to eventually pursue a PhD in robotics. Outside of school, he enjoys reading (especially books by Joyce or Dostoevsky), playing tennis, working on home-grown robotics projects, and fly fishing.

# Research
Nelson joined the FROST Lab in April 2023 and is currently working with a team to design and build low-cost autonomous underwater vehicles that can be used for multi-agent communication and coordination research in the near future.
