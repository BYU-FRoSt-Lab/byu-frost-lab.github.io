# About
Ben is a Master's student in Electrical Engineering. He's interested in robot localization and mapping, control systems, and autonomous vehicles. He graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering in April 2024. Ben started in the FROST Lab in August 2024. In his free time, he loves spending time with his family. He also loves to fish, hike, camp, play football, ultimate frisbee, tennis, and pickleball when time permits.

# Research
Ben is working on algorithms for mapping and localization for an autonomous golf cart, specifically focusing on map expansion and long-term mapping. The end goal is for the golf cart to give tours around BYU autonomously. This will help excite future students about STEM majors and show how cool robotics and engineering is.
